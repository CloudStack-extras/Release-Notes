	<title>2.2.4</title>
	<para>&PRODUCT; 2.2.4 was released on 16 May 2011</para>
	<important>
		<para>The behavior of storage allocation is more conservative 
		in 2.2.4 than in 2.1.7 and prior releases or 2.2.0-2.2.3. 
		&PRODUCT; will no longer create volumes on primary storage
		 resources that have a storage percentage used higher than that
		 defined by <firstterm> 
		<indexterm><primary>storage.capacity.threshold</primary></indexterm>
		</firstterm>
		 global configuration. Previously &PRODUCT; would allocate a 
		primary storage resource up to 100% full. This space reservation
		 is required as a fix to cases where snapshots of VMs could 
		not be taken when the storage had been allocated to 100% full. 
		The use of a threshold setting allows the administrator to 
		reserve space for snapshots in progress for existing volumes. 
		Deployments with primary storage that is close to full should 
		examine the value of this parameter before upgrading. If all 
		primary storage resources are more full than 
		<indexterm><primary>storage.capacity.threshold</primary></indexterm>
		 no new volumes can be created after upgrade.
